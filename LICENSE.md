# ***The Community Public Software License (CPSL) v0.1***

## ***Preamble***

*This license is designed to ensure that software remains a community asset, fostering a collaborative ecosystem where both developers and users can thrive. It grants the freedoms to use, study, modify, and redistribute the software, while establishing a social contract centered on the principle of widespread accessibility.*

*This license rejects the notion that "free" means "zero-cost" and explicitly permits charging for distribution and services. However, it requires that any such commercial activity be conducted in a manner that empowers the user community, rather than creating prohibitive financial barriers.*

## ***Definitions***

* ***"The Program"**: Refers to the collection of software files licensed under the CPSL.*  
* ***"Source Code"**: The preferred form of the Program for making modifications, including all modules, interface definitions, and scripts used to control compilation and installation.*  
* ***"You"**: An individual or entity exercising permissions granted by this license.*  
* ***"Recipient"**: Anyone who receives the Program from you.*

## ***1\. Core Freedoms***

*You are granted the following irrevocable rights for the Program:*

1. ***Freedom to Use**: The freedom to run the Program for any purpose, private or commercial.*  
2. ***Freedom to Study and Modify**: The freedom to access the Source Code to study how the Program works and to change it to meet your needs.*  
3. ***Freedom to Redistribute**: The freedom to redistribute copies of the original or your modified versions of the Program, in either binary or Source Code form, to others.*

## ***2\. Conditions of Redistribution***

*When you redistribute the Program to a Recipient, you must fulfill the following conditions:*

* *You must provide the Recipient with a copy of this license.*  
* *You must provide the Recipient with access to the complete, corresponding Source Code.*  
* *You must ensure that any modified versions you distribute are clearly marked as such.*

## ***3\. The Community Covenant (Accessibility Clause)***

*As a primary condition of redistribution, you agree to offer the Program at a price that promotes **widespread accessibility**.*

*The fee for your distribution service, if any, should be structured to empower end-users, not to create a prohibitive financial barrier that limits the Program's adoption and utility. This license is granted with the understanding that the Program is a community asset, and redistribution is not to be used as a vehicle for price gouging.*

## ***4\. Security and Trust Advisory***

***NOTICE**: This Program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.*

*For your own security, it is strongly recommended that you acquire this Program from a trusted distributor. If you received this Program from an unofficial source, you are encouraged to verify its integrity via checksums or digital signatures provided by the original authors before execution to protect yourself from potentially malicious modifications.*

## ***5\. Patent Protection***

*Each contributor grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Program.*

***Disclaimer**: This is a draft (v0.1) and is not a legally vetted document. It is intended to capture a specific ethical and business framework. For legally binding use, consult with a lawyer specializing in software licensing.*
